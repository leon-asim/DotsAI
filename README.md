Dots is a strategic game that requires attention and planning skills.

Basic Rules:

-At the start of the game, the playing field is an empty grid.
-Players take turns placing a dot at the intersections of the grid lines.
-Each surrounded enemy dot becomes the territory of the player who encircled it.
-The game continues until all the free cells are filled or until no new territories can be created.
-The winner is the player who captures the majority of the field by the end of the game.

Objective of the Game: 

To surround the opponent's dots, creating enclosed areas.

But instead of real people, you can play one of the 2 agents or watch them play between themselves. The agents are based on Minimax and Expectimax
